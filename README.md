# AppDNA SDK for Flutter

The official Flutter SDK for [AppDNA](https://appdna.ai) — the growth console for subscription apps.

> ⚠️ **Proprietary software.** A Commercial Agreement with AppDNA AI, Inc. is required to use this SDK. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md).
>
> **Migrating from MIT-licensed v1.0.0 or earlier?** See [DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md](./DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md). MIT versions stop receiving server support after **15 May 2026**.

## What it does

AppDNA gives you a single drop-in SDK for the growth surfaces every subscription app needs, on both iOS and Android from one Dart codebase:

- **Analytics & events** — track user behavior with batched, offline-resilient delivery.
- **Experiments & feature flags** — server-driven A/B tests with deterministic variant assignment.
- **Paywalls** — render console-designed paywall layouts with native StoreKit 2 / Google Play Billing.
- **Onboarding flows** — multi-step onboarding with form inputs, async hooks, conditional branching, and rich media.
- **Surveys & feedback** — NPS, CSAT, free text, multi-choice with scheduling and frequency caps.
- **In-app messages** — modal, banner, fullscreen messages with audience targeting.
- **Push notifications** — rich content, action buttons, deep links, and delivery analytics.
- **Web entitlements & deep links** — server-validated entitlements and deferred deep linking.

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.10+
- Dart 3.0+
- iOS 16.0+ (when targeting iOS)
- Android API 24+ (when targeting Android)

## Installation

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  appdna_sdk:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/appdna-ai/appdna-sdk-flutter.git
      ref: v1.0.6
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

For iOS, also run:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:appdna_sdk/appdna_sdk.dart';

await AppDNA.configure('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

Track an event:

```dart
await AppDNA.track('subscription_viewed', {'plan_id': 'premium_monthly'});
```

Identify a user (after sign-in):

```dart
await AppDNA.identify('user-123', {'plan': 'premium'});
```

Present a paywall:

```dart
final result = await AppDNA.presentPaywall(id: 'default');
switch (result) {
  case PaywallResult.purchased:
    print('Purchased');
  case PaywallResult.dismissed:
    print('Dismissed');
  case PaywallResult.failed:
    print('Failed');
}
```

## Native host setup

The SDK renders on the native layer, so a few host-side assets/declarations are required.
Full copy-paste instructions are in the docs; the essentials:

### Firebase config asset (required for online config + push)

AppDNA loads paywalls, onboarding, experiments, flags, and push over a dedicated Firebase
app. Place the config file(s) AppDNA gives you (**Settings → SDK → Download Config**) as
native assets — nothing config-driven loads without them:

- **iOS** — `GoogleService-Info-AppDNA.plist` in `ios/Runner/`.
- **Android** — `google-services-appdna.json` in `android/app/src/main/assets/`.

A cross-platform app downloads both in one ZIP.

### Offline-first config bundle (optional)

To ship a config snapshot that loads instantly offline, place `appdna-config.json` as a
native asset (`ios/Runner/` and/or `android/app/src/main/assets/`). Native `configure()`
auto-loads it as the offline fallback; online config takes over once fetched.

### Host permissions (only for flows that use them)

Onboarding flows that request a permission need the matching OS declaration in the host app
— e.g. `NSCameraUsageDescription` / `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription` in
`ios/Runner/Info.plist`, or `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>` in
`AndroidManifest.xml`. A missing declaration doesn't crash — the permission is simply
unavailable, so the flow step can't advance. See the docs for the full per-permission table.

## Embedded screen slots

Most surfaces (onboarding, paywalls, surveys, messages) present natively over your app. For
an **inline** server-driven screen region, embed the platform-view widget:

```dart
AppDNAScreenSlot(name: 'home_hero', height: 220)
```
